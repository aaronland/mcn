# mcn

This repository provides archives of the MCN conference in varying degrees of "structured" data and tools for producing those archives.

## Important

This repository is incomplete. It is a "first stab" at preserving conference schedule data hosted on third-party services. So far, only data for 2020, 2021 and 2023 has been captured in a kind of minimal-viable raw form. There is plenty left to do so any contributions are welcome.
