SUMMARY:Lessons from the Coronavirus: There Is No “Pivot”
DESCRIPTION:The 2020 pandemic upended most museums' business and engagement strategy for the year. It exposed the foundations underlying our efforts across digital\, good and bad\, and in many cases\, it caught us flat-footed. Digital groups acted quickly to change their mandate entirely. The goal of digital engagement and marketing shifted from driving visitation to a physical place\, to creating an equally compelling online museum. Digital teams had to figure out quickly how to engage audiences stuck at home with no chance to visit their institutions. The call for change was quick\, often panicked\, and came from all leadership levels. This was often referred to as a pivot. Is this an accurate description of how digital teams responded or was the quick response a reflection of the way digital professionals work on a regular basis? Our discussion will explore this topic\, among others.In this informal discussion\, three digital leaders will talk about the ways that what has been described as a rapid\, freewheeling “pivot” was actually doable because of well-laid foundational plans\, skills\, and teamwork. We will discuss the reasons why our digital teams were positioned to succeed in the quickly changing environment of the COVID-19 closure\, how we adapted\, and what this reinforces for how we can work in the future. We will also explore lessons learned\, and demonstrate the distinction between pivoting versus building on top of groundwork that had been in the planning for years\, utilizing existing collaborative structures and systems upon which we had long relied.In this session\, we hope a discussion of the lessons learned from this pandemic\, and from the ‘pivot’ will help museums plan for a better future\, and not get caught flat-footed in the next global crisis.

SUMMARY:Virtual Teen Programs/Real Connections
DESCRIPTION:With Covid-19 and stay-at-home orders\, many of our programs needed to switch from in-person to virtual spaces. Our focus was on teen audiences and making these transitions for everything from workshops to council meetings to internships. Our panel will share some of the best practices we developed\, tools we used\, and challenges we overcame. We will share how we sought the input and voice of teens during the process\, and how we incorporated their ideas and feedback. Much of this work will continue in the months between proposal and presentation\, and we look forward to sharing that real-time learning with you.Questions that we are asking ourselves include:How do we maintain relationships with teens we know\, and how do we forge meaningful developmental relationships with teens we are meeting virtually for the first time? How do we reach people\, especially with inequitable technology access? What and how do we need to change to align with what young people need right now?

SUMMARY:Touch and Multi-sensory Experiences: Developing Safe and Inclusive Practices During Covid-19
DESCRIPTION:Safety\, Comfort\, and Inclusion: We Choose AllBuilding off 2019’s MCN session Multi-Sensory Design Towards Inclusion and Access\, Sina Bahram and Corey Timpson examine and surface the details related to ensuring rich inclusion and access for onsite and remote audiences\, given the world we now find ourselves in. Ensuring safe\, comfortable\, sustainable\, and equitable experience design requires a multifaceted approach across several operational touch points. This session examines intention\, design\, execution\, management\, and maintenance across the museum enterprise\, focusing on strategic objectives and practical tactics for sustainable solutions.Accessible Touch ObjectsCurrently\, the majority of museum and historic site experiences are visual and lack tactile alternatives for visitors. In this session we describe our efforts to better understand the challenges and opportunities for sustaining and expanding tactile objects in museums through conducting interviews with 15 museum access specialists from museums ranging in size and location. We discuss the responses from six accessibility experts who identified as blind or low vision to the museums current practices. From our findings\, we identify and describe seven different types of touch objects currently being used at museums\, which is the most inclusive and descriptive taxonomy to date. We discuss their design processes\, trade-offs\, usefulness\, and value compared to audio and virtual tours. Finally\, we share design recommendations for museum practitioners: 1) preserving touch experiences during COVID--19\, urgently called for by BLV accessibility experts\, 2) considering three additional touch object categories from an interview with a BLV accessibility expert not previously used or mentioned by the museum access specialists\, 3) avoiding a one size fits all solution and offer visitors the opportunity to personalize the content and modality of touch objects. Our findings illustrate the diversity and importance of touch interactions in creating accessible educational experiences.

SUMMARY:Innovation Mindset (Plenary Panel)
DESCRIPTION:Digital transformation is often confused with or considered synonymous to technology. Digital transformation is about delivering on the Museum’s mission\, and leveraging technology to achieve that whether it be new offerings and experiences\, reaching new audiences in new ways\, new and more efficient ways of operating. It’s rarely a conversation about the specific technology\, and much more about how technology achieves a goal.In the first section of this session\, Catherine Devine and Samantha Diamond engage in a discussion about continuous innovation in Museums\, the necessity and importance of it\, the mindset needed\, and how that innovation mindset distinguishes organizations that will ultimately thrive through this crisis. Samantha Diamond is outgoing MCN board member\, CEO and Founder of Culture Connect\, recently acquired by Axiell\, and also VP\, Digital Engagement at Axiell. Axiell/Culture Connect is a Microsoft partner.The second section of this session will profile Jack LaPan from RedLevel\, another Microsoft partner. Jack LaPan has worked with many Museums in the US\, and is focused on unique approaches to technology adoption\, starting with what the organization is trying to achieve and then leveraging technology to deliver on those. Jack will discuss a specific approach on Cloud Immersion Experiences which looks at how teams innovate with collaboration.Brought to you by Microsoft.

SUMMARY:Experiential Design for an Unknown Future
DESCRIPTION:View the pre-recorded presentation to prepare for this live Q&A SessionAt Bluecadet\, we’re always exploring different methods for integrating digital products into public space. Now\, there’s added urgency as we’re tasked with integrating aspects of public space into our digital products. Our ongoing R&D projects are becoming ways for us to support new public health and safety concerns. Like a lot of design agencies\, the crisis may have blurred our vision of the future\, but it's sharpened our focus on the task at hand.This talk will concentrate on the impact of four categories towards experiences in an uncertain future: overall digital strategy\, spatial design\, input methods\, and the extended experience. These categories aren’t mutually exclusive and\, indeed\, are most effective when employed together. Redundancy and flexibility will be essential moving forward — we can anticipate and plan for some uses but there are many\, many others that we can't. That same flexibility also has implications for the longevity and sustainability of what we build.

SUMMARY:Help wanted: MCN & NEW INC seek feedback on case study template for musetech digital projects web resource
DESCRIPTION:With the support from a Knight Foundation grant\, MCN is partnering with NEW INC\, New Museum’s art and technology incubator\, to launch a new web resource for the museum tech community. Through this new resource\, we will capture and share model projects and experiments from across our community\, with a goal of creating a centralized repository that anyone can use to advance their own understanding of how to creatively integrate technology into museum digital practice. Over the past few years\, the field has made remarkable advancements and the goal of this joint project is to create a home for documenting and discussing this work.The format of our platform -- how information is collected\, how it is categorized\, how it is presented -- is being jointly developed over the next few months by MCN and NEW INC. These two 60-minute Experimental sessions are part of our discovery process\, during which we'll share some early case study templates and seek participants' feedback as we develop a new framework for capturing innovative digital projects in the field.YOU MUST PRE-REGISTER HERE TO ATTEND THIS SESSION ZOOM MEETING!

SUMMARY:Interaction Beyond the Touchscreen
DESCRIPTION:Recognizing our new normal under COVID-19 restrictions it is important to consider visitor engagement with onsite digital experiences. In some regions\, government restrictions have mandated that all touchscreen interactives remain off when museums re-open. In other regions visitors have been variably reluctant or willing to interact with touchscreens. Public sentiment and policy is evolving in real time and is difficult to generalize so what are museums to do?Is this an opportunity for museums to rethink the digital experience in-gallery? Is this a rebirth of BYOD experiences or a chance for something completely different? Are fringe benefits accrued by rethinking digital engagement?Panelists from the USA\, Canada\, UK and Australia will discuss steps taken at their museums to meet these challenges and will also share visitor responses to these new forms of interaction.

SUMMARY:Stories of Resilience and Resistance: What Happens When Cyclical Work Becomes Sisyphean?
DESCRIPTION:This session aims to explore Sisyphean efforts—or everyday endeavors that become endless and in turn ineffective and burdensome—and pathways that professionals at different stages of their career have used to navigate such difficulties. Whether it is in the realm of system administration\, grant applications\, or emotional labor\, workers in our sector must creatively navigate the variety of iterative work or environments that can generate feelings of helplessness and fatigue. Through group storytelling and reflection\, we will explore what it means to shoulder that burden\, cast off (or shatter) the boulder\, and the ways in which resilience can both help and hurt. In doing so\, this session seeks to collectively discover the many routes that land us in such efforts\, and share experiences that lead to their resolution\, disruption\, or sustainability.We would love for you to submit your story for our group reflection!

SUMMARY:Bright Spots: Creating Social Media Moments of Joy During a Pandemic
DESCRIPTION:During the earlier days of the pandemic and while death rates reached their peaks\, museums and cultural organizations shuttered their doors. While institutions turned their focus to engaging with audiences virtually\, some museums created campaigns to offer a reprieve from a bleak news cycle. These institutions elicited unexpected joy\, humor\, and moments of kindness—sorely needed by online communities. Join staff from the New-York Historical Society\, Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden\, Shedd Aquarium\, Field Museum\, and Smithsonian’s National Zoo to explore four digital storytelling campaigns that reached record audiences during the pandemic.The New-York Historical Society and Hirshhorn Museum combined forces to send virtual flowers from their collections to museum colleagues around the globe for #MuseumBouquet\, and followed the campaign by shedding virtual sunshine before Earth Day with sunny works for #MuseumSunshine.The Shedd Aquarium let their penguins roam free through their exhibits to the delight of online audiences. News of the penguins went viral on social media and in the press. The jaunts of one penguin named Wellington earned himself the hashtag #WheresWellingtonWednesday. The penguins interacted with wildlife elsewhere in the space that they would never encounter in nature.In response to the Shedd’s penguins\, the Field Museum rolled out a series of “unSUEpervised” videos wherein an inflatable SUE the T. rex ran amok through empty exhibitions and office spaces. SUE’s visit to the Hall of Birds was covered by E! News and CNN\, and the series of videos has been watched over 1.69 million times.In efforts to “bring the zoo to you\,” the National Zoo’s Cub Cam offered a real-time view of four\, fuzzy cheetah cubs born April 8 at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute. Online audiences tuned in for the birth\, were invited to vote on names for the cubs\, and are following their growth through #CheetahCubdates and #NatZooZen on social media.These cultural organizations span living collections\, natural history\, American history\, and contemporary art. Although each of these institutions have a different mission and focus\, each tapped into the public’s need for joy during a turbulent time.

SUMMARY:Money Matters: Driving Revenue through Business Model Innovation
DESCRIPTION:Link to presentation: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12F4A1ORfdq_AvGe8QbAN_9FYuKVQuv_CFKPSNw3Eb_E/edit?usp=sharingRevenue is often treated as a dirty word within the non-profit and cultural sectors\, but it is crucial to achieving financial sustainability. Furthermore\, it is not static; continuous innovation is needed simply to sustain one’s position in a marketplace\, let alone expand in reach and impact. The past year has brought such needs even further to the fore\, as primary forms of revenue generation - admissions\, special exhibitions\, etc. - have been shut down and organizations have had to scramble to bring in money through methods both familiar and brand-new.In this session\, participants will learn-by-doing: working through a series of steps to generate\, share\, and build upon each others’ ideas for revenue creation through new offerings\, services\, and business models. We will introduce simple innovation frameworks to guide the activity\, which can be easily applied at participant’s home institutions. Session leaders (and participants) will bring examples as inspiration\, and to help participants challenge their orthodoxies and think expansively on how they might bring in revenue\, while aligning with and further advancing their mission.The session will apply a few ‘lenses’ to accelerate this process\, including membership\, programming\, and partnerships. At the conclusion of the session\, participants will have a view towards developing and maintaining a balanced portfolio of revenue-generating innovation.Deep Dive sign-ups open Wednesday\, September 9. Space is limited and advance registration is required—so mark your calendars! Once sessions are filled\, there will be a waitlist and MCN will notify attendees as spots become available.

SUMMARY:Designing Inclusive Learning Path through Digital Storytelling: A Pilot Experimentation in a VR Interactive Etruscan Exhibition
DESCRIPTION: View the pre-recorded presentation to prepare for this live Q&A SessionIn recent years\, museums are growingly recognized to be educational sites which could promote social and cultural integration through different methodologies such as Digital Storytelling (DST)\, Virtual Reality (VR) and Personalised Education. Starting from this assumption\, the Centre for Museum Studies Roma TRE University (IT) has been working for the last three years in the “Inclusive Memory” project (http://host.uniroma3.it/progetti/inclusivememory/en/index.html) based on the idea that cultural heritage within the museum could be exploited as a social and active participation driver. The experimentation here presented is aimed at testing an Inclusive VR Etruscan Exhibition designed to foster the construction of a shared collective social memory by combining DST methodologies with learning instructions based on Visual Thinking and Critical Reflection.The learning paths were meant to blend the physical visit at the National Etruscan museum "Villa Giulia" (Rome) with Digital Stories available by a custom-designed App for smartphone. The stories were designed to represent the voices of the minorities\, stigmatized and marginalized groups such as migrants\, elder people\, people with cognitive/physical impairments and women. However\, the worldwide Covid 19 health emergency - together with the need to follow social distancing - required us to redesign the visit and\, as a consequence\, we tried to turn this challenge into an opportunity. We asked ourselves “How we could visit Museums in the new post-covid world based on digital experiences?”In this new scenario\, virtual interactive exhibition could be one of the possible solution. To do this\, we had to design cultural and educational interfaces. We proposed a particular experience of interactive virtual museum. The user - after an initial profiling phase - is required to collect the Etruscan coins placed above the main museum objects. After gaining the coin\, an object-related story pops up on the screen. Different kinds of interactive activities were designed to stimulate the user learning experience: all the stories are interactive containing questions aimed at stimulating the user reflection. In addition\, the user is invited to answer an open-ended question designed to both stimulate and assess Critical Thinking Skills.The interactive virtual museum should not be simply conceived as a simulation of the physical museum experience. The aim is to offer a completely different experience - virtual and augmented - of the museum exhibition. Thus\, we exploited a visual abstraction approach. Firstly\, it was necessary to design the museum space in 3D - through 3D modeling software Rhinoceros. For greater clarity and conceptual abstraction\, it was decided to design the rooms of the museum\, according to a typical architectural plan of contemporary buildings at the Etruscan Museum: a row of rooms in succession. Each section follows the same pattern: inside the room there is the main exhibition object - also designed in 3D - and five abstract empty display cases.Then\, the specific User Interface for the interaction between the user and the space / object has been designed. Through a first prototyping with the software Adobe XD\, it was possible to define the wireframes and the graphic and interaction elements of the interface. Subsequently\, the project has been uploaded in the Unity platform for coded development. The interface reflects the maximum inclusiveness fees for DSA and non-DSA subjects. The strong use of visual contrasts given by the color palette\, and the choice of a specific typeface - Biancoenero font - make the interface easy to read without losing elegance and style.For the first experimentation\, we tested only one of the six learning paths named “The highest ambition of a woman in ancient societies ... and today?”. The learning path describes the contrast between the subordinate role of the woman in the ancient Greek society and the strong figure of the powerful barbarian sorceress Medea\, an outcast in Greece. A group of (N) post-graduate students in “Museum Education” will test the Virtual Learning Path. Our research questions are the following: 1. Do participants enjoy the visit? 2. Does Virtual Learning Path stimulate participants’ critical reflection? 3. Are there any correlations among participants characteristics and their preferences for stories\, pieces of arts and fruition styles? In order to answer these questions\, different kinds of data will be collected and analysed: log data and participants reactions to stories and pieces of arts will be used to understand to which extent participants enjoy the visit. These data will be also used to calculate correlation with participants personal characteristics (e.g. gender\, age\, personality traits\, artistic preferences and so on). Open-ended answers will be analysed through a content analysis methodology to assess participants’ crit...

SUMMARY:Bring Your Own Device and In-Hand Interactives: How Covid-19 Forced Innovation in Our Interactives
DESCRIPTION:Bring Your Own DeviceIn 2015 the Cooper Hewitt Smithsonian Design Museum launched the Pen\, an interactive stylus that allows visitors to collect objects on display by tapping wall labels embedded with NFC tags\, and saving them to an online Cooper Hewitt account. In 2020 this functionality was reproduced as a standalone\, and open-source\, iOS application as a way to prove that it is within the means of cultural heritage institutions to do what was done with the Pen\, at Cooper Hewitt\, sector-wide. [1]An open-source "bring your own pen device" offers a way for institutions without the means or the ability to develop or distribute bespoke hardware like the Pen the ability to let their visitors take their visit with them and to revisit it at a later date. Importantly it provides a technical and conceptual scaffolding that allows an institution to participate in that remembering. Every year there are thousands\, perhaps millions\, of photographs of objects or their wall labels that visitors take during museum visits that exist in isolation without any meaningful connection back to the object itself\, the institution that shepherds it or the broader collection it is a part of. A "bring your pen device" is a tangible first step towards bridging that gap.This presentation will discuss the history\, implementation and technical details of the project. It will also discuss next steps and how the project can be adapted to work with institutions that lack the budget or the staff for large or sophisticated digital initiatives and how it might be adapted to work across different institutions (for example Museum Mile in New York City or the different Smithsonian museums in Washington).Finally it will make an argument for a renewed and modular approach to software development by and for the cultural heritage sector in order that we might develop a re-usable toolbox\, or kit of parts\, that can be re-configured quickly and easily to adapt to the needs of different institutions.[1] https://www.aaronland.info/weblog/2020/06/16/revisiting/#penIn-Hand IneractivesAs Covid-19 took hold of the world and changed the way we interact with each other\, the Cincinnati Museum Center (CMC) began to explore how we would engage our visitors during a pandemic. Being known for our interactive experiences\, we explored ways our guests would experience these interactives in no-touch ways upon reopening. These options included investing in gesture control\, providing styluses\, removing interactives\, installing new hardware\, and more. After much thought\, we landed on developing a new experience called “CMC In-Hand Interactives”In-Hand Interactives is a web-based experience offering much of the same content of our interactives via a mobile device. It offered the most economical solution that could be quickly developed and highly engaging. Having just invested in new interactives during our restoration\, this path would also allow us to return our interactives to operations once the pandemic threat had ended. Additionally\, CMC’s board\, leadership\, and staff wanted to use this as the foundation and learning opportunity for how we engage our guests digitally in the future. Finally\, CMC developed a partnership with Digimarc to effectively deliver the content to our guests. By scanning a digitally embedded barcode in artwork\, guests could be launched directly to the content.In this session\, we will explore the process from ideation\, evaluating solutions\, leveraging existing content\, re-imagining the guest experience for mobile\, building a new web platform\, and delivering this content to our guests.

SUMMARY:Social Distance = Distance Learning
DESCRIPTION:In the time of social distancing\, we need distance learning more than ever. Museums around the country are turning to this medium as a way to sustain their relationships with existing audiences and open their digital doors to new ones. In this moderated panel discussion\, the panelists will share how their museums have responded to the novel coronavirus through distance learning\, such as virtual field trips\, online courses\, and mixed reality programs. Each museum has varying levels of experience with distance learning but the global pandemic has caused them to either kickstart\, expand\, or reexamine the programming they offer in order to meaningfully engage audiences while the physical buildings remain closed.This session will share those stories and explore questions such as: how does distance learning uniquely explores the tension between transformation and longevity? how can museums transform successful onsite programs into online learning and how do you maximize digital spaces for learning? How do you get institutional buy-in to rapidly shift the focus of staff and resources to new types of programming? How can museums see this as an opportunity to sustain existing relationships with their audiences and invite new visitors in?This session will investigate the MCN theme of Sustainability by exploring what distance learning technologies and practices look like in the face of disruption as a result of COVID-19 and how this transformation impacts the long-term goals of their department and/or institution. It will address themes from Strand 1 by sharing how museums have created new strategies via distance learning to engage audiences as a result of COVID-19 closures.The panelists in this session represent three types and sizes of museums\, from three geographic areas\, and three levels of experience with distance learning. This mixture of experience will provide a rich discussion around transformation and sustainability in engaging audiences through distance learning. They include:- A regional history museum that has never utilized distance learning but is switching gears to overhaul their programs;- A national history museum that has existing K-12 virtual field trips\, and higher ed and lifelong learning online programming\, but exploring online offerings for teacher professional development;- A statewide art museum that has experiences in different forms of distance learning for various audiences and expanding into mixed reality.The moderator is a museum consultant with expertise in distance learning and podcasting\, so can mediate a lively interactive discussion between panelists and virtual attendees.During the session\, the moderator would facilitate Q&A in the chat throughout the session; attendees and panelists could use the chat to provide resources to each other in real time; use polling to stimulate discussion or focus the conversation in ways that are most relevant to the attendees; and play a game with panelists and attendees at the end of the session!

SUMMARY:A Flexible\, Touchfree Interactive Platform for Exhibiting Physical and Digital Student Works in a University Library
DESCRIPTION:View the pre-recorded presentation to prepare for this live Q&A SessionWe will present a case study sharing the design and development process for a new interactive exhibit space at the North Carolina State University Libraries\, called the Innovation Studio. The Libraries collaborated with Relative Scale of Raleigh\, NC to realize an experience built around interactive projection\, designed as a lightweight and mostly “touchfree” approach to digital interactives. This interaction design\, and the content platform that underlies it\, facilitate dynamic exhibition in a multi-use space—one that is central to a larger transformation happening in the newly renovated Hill Library. The Innovation Studio exhibition platform affords a new approach to collecting student work (in both digital and physical form) and sharing their stories\, further situating the library as a forum and community space.In designing for flexibility—the exhibits will often need to be removed so the Studio can be used for teaching—interactive projection won out over bulky touch tables\, leading to a “touchfree” approach that is also uniquely ready for the shift in user experience caused by COVID-19. We’ll share our technical process of UX design\, prototyping\, concept development and the interplay between NC State & Relative Scale; and particularly focus on the challenges of interaction design and our content model\, which allows for different types of works (digital\, physical\, and hybrid) and the rich diversity of a University community.

SUMMARY:Making ‘The Digital Future of Museums’
DESCRIPTION:The Digital Future of Museums: Conversations and Provocations' (March 2020\, Routledge) explores the role of digital technology in contemporary museum practice within Europe\, the U.S.\, Australasia and Asia through interviews with 24 museum practitioners\, thinkers\, and experts in related fields from a diverse range of backgrounds and geographies.In this session\, the book’s authors will synthesize their learnings from the interviews\, and offer provocations and reflections about effective practice that will help prepare today’s museums for tomorrow. Topics covered in the book include post-digital/post-normal museum making; trust\, truth\, data\, privacy and personalisation; digital collections and source communities; digital platforms and practices; institutional change and leadership; interactivity and immersion and many more. This session will focus on the necessity of deep dialogues\, community ownership\, local relevance and social impact for museum digital practice now and into the future. It is less about sustainability in the sense of “sustaining orgs as they are” and much more focused on how to sustain and be successful while undergoing the necessary changes that are demanded of us. It’s a progressive and challenging project\, fit for these complex times.Beyond this synthesis\, this session will include a facilitated discussion with two additional experts to track the changes since the book was developed\, including the impact of COVID-19\, the museum labor movement and the push to anti-racism in shaping museum digital practice going forward*.* Given the evolving context\, the two participants will be named closer to the conference date to ensure relevance. We will be intersectional in our choice of experts.

SUMMARY:“This Isn’t a Question but a Comment...” Unpacking Misogyny in Musetech
DESCRIPTION:This session seeks to explore and unpack misogyny in museums\, and specifically within musetech and STEAM. Internalized misogyny\, microaggressions\, overt harassment and assault\, retaliation and abuse. The reckoning started with #MuseumMeToo… except we’re still facing it today\, in even more insidious ways as white cishet feminism often overrides the voices of BIPOC folks and LGBTQIA+ folks. We want to provide attendees with the tools they need to recognize the different manifestations of misogyny\, with robust discussion\, and some much-needed catharsis.

SUMMARY:Redirecting Power: Holding Institutions Accountable in Responsible and Effective Ways
DESCRIPTION:Note that this session is now open to all attendees. There is no capacity limit on this session. As the world faces dual pandemics of the Covid crisis and structural racism\, the field has experienced an exacerbation of already-critical systemic issues. In the past\, the power and resources of institutions have kept staff and issues silenced\, going unaddressed and free of accountability. As colleagues across the field have experienced the consequences\, many have decided to take action to demand better workplaces and practices in serving our communities. Co-presenters invested in these efforts will share case studies + resources while opening space for discussion\, disagreement and brainstorming.

SUMMARY:Effects Of Shelter-In-Place On Museum Website Visitation: Findings From A Cross-institutional Study
DESCRIPTION:For many museums\, website visitation traditionally supported on-site visitation. What changed with shelter-in-place? We will present cross-industry trends revealed by an analysis of quantitative and qualitative data aggregated from eighteen institutions across the country\, some small\, some medium\, some large. We will compare and contrast with deep dives into the data of the J. Paul Getty Museum and the Whitney Museum of American Art.

SUMMARY:OBJ vs. GIF: An Comparative Analysis of Expense and Accessibility in Cultural Heritage Digitization
DESCRIPTION:View the pre-recorded presentation to prepare for this live Q&A Session3D digitization involves the creation of digital surrogates of museum objects. The use of 3D modelling technology in cultural heritage institutions has rapidly increased over the past twenty years. While light-dependent imaging techniques\, including photogrammetry\, laser triangulation\, LiDAR\, and range scanning\, have proliferated in the museum\, more questions remain about long-term model\, metadata\, and overall file standards. The files produced from these methods\, often OBJ\, PLY\, and STL files\, given their long-lasting usage\, offer a comparative focus for analyzing the expertise and expense needed to create and share these files\, which may put the technology out of reach of small to middle-size cultural heritage institutions and may prohibit non-research parties from accessing these file types. In order to combat these issues\, until these 3D file types become more accessible and standardized along with their methods\, the author recommends the creation of 360 degree GIF files as an inexpensive\, accessible\, and effective alternative for cultural heritage digitization.

SUMMARY:Video Content Strategy: Moving Beyond the Museum
DESCRIPTION:What does a strategy for video content and distribution look like? And should that strategy change in the coronavirus era? Panelists from four very different art museums will tell you about the overarching video strategies at their institutions\, and discuss how the pandemic changed everything—or nothing—for them.Video has become central to the overall communications strategy for many institutions\, and a key method conveying the institution’s brand identity. Having a strategy to guide the production of these complex pieces of content\, which often require significant time and money to create\, is critical. Panelists will discuss the strengths and weaknesses of their pre-coronavirus strategies\, and apply lessons learned from the pandemic to address key questions. How can we produce meaningful content in a world where our main sources—the museum space\, the exhibitions and all other activities—are locked down? Have audience expectations shifted around video? Will a strong digital strategy carry you through a pandemic\, where audiences are largely living and working online? What new opportunities does the coronavirus era offer?Topics addressed will include selecting the right video tool for the job\, how to design video for specific distribution platforms\, live vs. pre-recorded video\, integrating video into your social media calendar\, empowering staff to help with production\, and how or if to adjust these techniques and strategies when the goal is no longer to drive people to visit the museum.On the diversity of our panel:While we all work in art museums\, the missions and relationships to our communities are very different. You will hear about strategies from a Scandinavian museum with a strong public service approach\, and three museums in the US: a small university museum\, a mid-size museum focused on contemporary arts and social justice\, a large metropolitan art museum. Presenters also offer different perspectives\, with backgrounds in technical video production\, journalism\, content production\, and business. Two of the panelists have never presented at MCN before.

SUMMARY:Help wanted: MCN & NEW INC seek feedback on case study template for musetech digital projects web resource
DESCRIPTION:With the support from a Knight Foundation grant\, MCN is partnering with NEW INC\, New Museum’s art and technology incubator\, to launch a new web resource for the museum tech community. Through this new resource\, we will capture and share model projects and experiments from across our community\, with a goal of creating a centralized repository that anyone can use to advance their own understanding of how to creatively integrate technology into museum digital practice. Over the past few years\, the field has made remarkable advancements and the goal of this joint project is to create a home for documenting and discussing this work.The format of our platform -- how information is collected\, how it is categorized\, how it is presented -- is being jointly developed over the next few months by MCN and NEW INC. These two 60-minute Experimental sessions are part of our discovery process\, during which we'll share some early case study templates and seek participants' feedback as we develop a new framework for capturing innovative digital projects in the field.YOU MUST PRE-REGISTER HERE TO ATTEND THIS SESSION ZOOM MEETING!

SUMMARY:Intro to GitHub for (Non-Coding) Cultural Heritage Professionals by (Non-Coding) Photographers
DESCRIPTION:The code repository GitHub is a great place to find projects shared by your colleagues and is also a way for groups to work together asynchronously. It is a community and technology built on top of a particular distributed version control method\, named git. Not just for code\, GitHub can be used for documents\, metadata\, and spreadsheets; you can even host a static website in a GitHub repository! In this introductory session\, Kjell and Charles will walk through the GitHub process to show how multiple users can contribute to a project at the same time - or at different times. Session participants may want to have a free GitHub login to take part in the project\, but it’s not required.

SUMMARY:Interdepartmental Approaches to Transforming Digital Workflow and Decision Making at the New-York Historical Society
DESCRIPTION:View the pre-recorded presentation to prepare for this live Q&A SessionDuring this 30 minute session\, we share how the New-York Historical Society took an interdepartmental approach to digital content management with the goal of deepening public engagement for education audiences online.Through a three-year grant\, a core group of staff from the IT\, Museum\, Library\, Exhibitions and Education departments received training on a variety of digital skills -- and shared out their training across the museum. Staff members brainstormed connections between one another's work to find ways to support online programming\, digital content\, and online collections. As an interdepartmental team\, staff also worked collaboratively to ensure the institution’s digital collections\, and the content management systems that organize them\, are optimized for public accessibility and for use in education programming. This allowed us to connect our digital staff to the needs of our core audience\, leading to increased culturally responsive museum content and\, in line with our unique mission\, more representation of non-dominant narratives of history for teachers and students.We will share our collaborative approach to transforming our museum’s digital workflow and decision making. Our experience has been that when staff from multiple departments learn aside one another\, creative ideas from across disciplines can be produced organically\, discussed immediately\, and implemented sustainably. Together we will explore tactics that panelists (and the audience) have used to enable museum staff to fully understand\, adopt and optimize digital technology in museums to further your mission.

SUMMARY:Nothing about Us Without Us.....Now More Than Ever
DESCRIPTION:Efforts around equity were some of the first casualties in institutions' fight for survival\, exposing how flippant some institutions consider DEAI measures. Institutions are still failing to understand that equity must be central to their missions and isn't just a fad. As the world pivots\, are institutions willing and able to critically engage with their entrenched biases and create new normals?

SUMMARY:Curator Brain\, Meet AI Brain
DESCRIPTION:View the pre-recorded presentation to prepare for this live Q&A SessionIs it possible to create an AI-based experience that feels truly native to a museum’s story? Our process uncovered that… this is the wrong question. We will discuss how The Henry Ford and Bluecadet used lo-fi prototyping\, collaborative workshops\, and open-ended technical sketching to explore a playful way into our broad\, seemingly disparate digital collections—and how we found an authentic use for AI as a part of a larger human-driven experience. We’ll explain how we integrated this experience into our existing digital collections infrastructure to enable easy updating and additional future experiences. Finally\, we will reflect on and discuss the future of our initial project—a communal\, touch-based experience—in a changed museum landscape.

SUMMARY:MuseWeb Master Class: Virtual Tours
DESCRIPTION:NOTE: capacity is limited to 35 attendees\, first-come\, first-served. No additional charge is required.A virtual tour is a form of semi-immersive VR technology that allows you to experience a certain location or virtual content remotely. The concept is to represent a real place in a virtual world that allows you to explore the place as if you are actually there.While virtual museum tours have been around for a long time with The Frick Collection offering virtual tours as early as 1999\, clearly over the past decade\, Virtual Reality (VR) has gone mainstream. Technology has advanced rapidly in the last few years and in addition to museums\, VR experiences can now be found at theme parks\, FECs\, retail malls and are now the hot item when selling or renting your house. By the year 2022\, the global VR market is estimated to grow to $209.2 billion. This is 7.7 times more than the 2018’s global market (data reference: Techjury.net). When the technology that museums use go mainstream it has both positive and negative impacts: prices go down while technology options go up at the same time the competition from mainstream media companies\, including gaming and tourism increases.Now COVID-19 has pulled most museums\, some screaming and crying\, on to the virtual reality bandwagon. Many museums were already providing virtual tours through Google Arts & Culture. This online platform has gained even more publicity during the lockdown. But as Museum Hack highlighted in April 2020\, “Virtual Museum Tours Were Popular for 4 Days”. So\, yes museums are adding VR to their offering but who is in charge and do they know what they are doing? Did anyone check who is the audience and what they are looking for? Are they doing it right and for that matter what is the right way to do it? Are they just throwing something up quick to make it seem like they care and failing and are there better ways to do it? How much should it cost\, and should they do it in house or outsource part or all of it?In this half day workshop\, we will take a closer look\, a virtual tour of virtual tours so to speak and explore examples from around the sector. We will review how VR allows museums to bring objects\, scenes and stories to life making it easier for visitors to understand and put them in context. In addition to these positive benefits\, we will review how many tours fail to leverage the technology and often ignore the visitors needs. We will explore what a tour virtual tour is\, what could it be about… from physical spaces to intangible content to building museums and hosting events in virtual worlds. We will walk you through a couple of different ways to do it\, from outsourcing the whole thing to DIY and from static tours to hybrid VR tours led by a tour guide. You will learn how much it costs and what combinations of equipment and software lets you do what parts of it yourself if you do it in house and what vendors can you outsource it to. We will explore the side benefits of this kind of documentation as well as all the pros and cons.You will learn:What is virtual reality?What is a virtual tour?How your museum can benefit from using virtual toursHow your visitors can benefit from virtual toursTools\, content and processes required to create a virtual tourHow to capture 360 panoramic imagesHow to create a virtual tour on your ownThis workshop is designed for museum professionals who are interested in both the practical and academic. Whether you own the virtual reality hardware and software and do it all in house or you want to outsource the whole thing and just review and post the final product\, this workshop is for you. By the end of this workshop you will no longer need to rely on any experts to help you create a virtual tour. You will be able to create compelling virtual tours on your own\, at the least possible expense.Co-Presenters:Rich Cherry\, Founder and Managing Partner\, Museum OperationsHiroko Kusano\, Managing Partner\, Museum OperationsDavid London\, Chief Experience Officer\, The Peale Center\, Baltimore

SUMMARY:Declaration on Open Access for Cultural Heritage: What are our Guiding Principles for Ethically Practicing Open in GLAM institutions?
DESCRIPTION:Cultural heritage institutions have been doing significant work on digitization for the last twenty years. The results of those efforts are now starting to pay off\, with more institutions adopting open access policies to share that digitized heritage with the world. However\, as the survey by Douglas McCarthy and Andrea Wallace showed\, there is no consensus on what “open” and “open access” means. There are also some fundamental considerations that need to acknowledge the complexities of managing cultural heritage and knowledge. Also\, for those institutions that are less well resourced\, more guidance is needed on how to take actual steps on enacting open access for cultural heritage.Creative Commons and other partners decided to step in to support some conversations on how to ethically practice Open Access. For that\, we are publishing a research paper on “Critical Open GLAM”\, that provides the research-based evidence to serve as a fundamental piece for building a Declaration on Open Access for Cultural Heritage.In this session\, we will review the key topics that we expect to be included in the Declaration\, including:The Legal Foundations of Open Access for Cultural HeritageNew Areas of Focus for Open Access for Cultural HeritageA Human Rights Perspective for Open GLAMCopyright & Open LicensingAccessibilityTraditional KnowledgePrivacyEthical considerations for Open AccessIn this session\, we will walk through the arguments we developed to inform policy makers and advocates that work with or within cultural heritage institutions. We expect that the Declaration will provide an actionable framework to inform policies in an evolving ecosystem\, where best practices will change as technologies and communities change.We will also inform people in this session how to provide comments and feedback\, and engage with the Declaration in different ways.

SUMMARY:Quick\, Nimble\, Relevant: Planning Content for the Unplannable (and Staying Sane in the Process)
DESCRIPTION:View the pre-recorded presentation to prepare for this live Q&A SessionWhen the future seems unplannable\, how do museums continue to offer their communities support\, storytelling\, and meaningful experiences? And how can overtaxed staff integrate these plans into under-budgeted workflows without losing their minds? COVID-19 has created not only immediate crises for museums\, but has also introduced profound unpredictability. Exhibition and operational plans must now must accommodate wildly varying future scenarios - additional shutdowns or relaxed restrictions\, recovery of staffing or further reductions\, and shifting budget projections.This session will offer practical strategies for integrating the creation of compelling\, flexible digital products into activities that museums are already doing. Learn about nimble and lightweight strategies for mining ongoing activity to create digital products that can be used in a wide variety of scenarios – from on-site display while facilities are open\, offering virtual exhibition experiences during a shutdown\, or promotional during reopening. The future of museums is quick\, nimble\, and relevant – learn how institutions of all sizes and technical capacity can take part.

SUMMARY:Big Questions for Museums and X Realities: A Virtual Town Hall
DESCRIPTION:The speakers are joined by moderators: Paige Dansiger\, Emily Kotecki\, Felicia Ingram\, Tina Shah\, Barry Joseph\, Michael Haley Goldman\, and Andrea Monteil du ShumanIn the last decade\, more and more museums have created experiences employing Virtual\, Augmented\, and other realities (abbreviated here as XR). Though we have learned a lot through these projects\, they have raised just as many important questions for the field. Several important areas for research have emerged including (but not limited to) questions of ethics\, equity and access\, educational impact\, and financial sustainability.This town-hall style conversation does not seek to answer these questions but to better define the most important issues as virtual technologies in museums become more mature. Facilitated by a team of professionals with a wide range of experience developing and researching XR in museums\, the session seeks to harness the expertise of everyone present to define a shared research agenda for the next stage of our collective work.This miniature summit on XR in museums will use a variety of techniques to include the ideas and questions from everyone present - including small break out discussions\, round-robin responses\, and collective documentation of the summits ideas. The results will help not only clarify the issues for practitioners developing museum XR\, it will also point the way to collectively addressing these issues.

SUMMARY:The Show Must Go On: Lessons From Theatre to #musetech in a COVID-19 World
DESCRIPTION:There is a significant number of individuals in the #musetech community\, and in the museum sector broadly\, who come from a background in theatre. The processes of theatre tend to be very attractive to #musetech professionals\, particularly in the areas of social media\, content management\, in-gallery interactives\, UX design\, extended reality\, and more. What is involved in the authenticity of theatrical experiences that hold lessons for planning in #musetech? Why do museum professionals prefer in some cases to hire those with a theatre background for museum work? How does the exchange of energy in theatre that also occurs in museums provide for virtual engagement in a COVID-19 world?You direct the conversation! This diverse panel of museum and historic site professionals with backgrounds in theatre will engage in a "Whose session is this\, anyway?" style of rapid fire improvisational riffing based on attendee selection of themes.

SUMMARY:Open GLAM for Critical Open Educational Resources: Free Knowledge Pedagogy Via Intercultural Co-Curation
DESCRIPTION:As the COVID-19 pandemic spread across the US and globally\, people have moved even more online. Students and educators—from K-12 to graduate school—followed suit. Meanwhile\, galleries\, libraries\, archives and museums (GLAM) shut their doors and tried to amplify virtual offerings to a public seeking entertainment as well as education from home. There is a lot of demand—and a lot of supply—in GLAM-related online educational resources (OER)\, as compiled by MCN and others. What works best\, what is needed\, and what will outlive lock-down? These are some of the questions that drive us into the future.This workshop dives into how GLAM OER can collaborate with disciplines and fields across and beyond academia—from museum studies to geography\, digital humanities to international relations\, postcolonialism to decolonial epistemology. University faculty\, students\, and self-educating learners are seeking international arts and culture content that is free from colonial legacies\, free from copyright\, and free from cost. What role does open GLAM have in these pedagogical needs? What would interactive\, engaging platforms look like that fostered intercultural dialogue and co-curation of Creative Commons and public domain arts and cultural content? What curricula are needed to help contextualize this content\, and extricate it from Eurocentric taxonomies and appropriative metadata?Deep Dive sign-ups open Wednesday\, September 9. Space is limited and advance registration is required—so mark your calendars! Once sessions are filled\, there will be a waitlist and MCN will notify attendees as spots become available.Hello good people~! SO excited to share virtual space with you all Thursday morning and to learn from each other~! We have a *great* line-up of engaged\, critical\, smart\, creative\, generous thought-leaders joining us:Featuring Adjoa Jones de Almeida Director of Education at Brooklyn Museum & Prof Namita Wiggers of Warren Wilson College & Critical Craft Forum & Virginia Poundstone\, artist and digital curator& scann Evelin Heidel\, of OpenGLAM\, tech feminist& Curationist graduate fellows:Francisca RudolphMagali DelgadoAndres de los RíosJing Cui
