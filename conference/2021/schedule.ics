SUMMARY:Digital Presence and Personal (or Organizational) Digital Strategy (Workshop 3)
DESCRIPTION:Workshops require advance registration on Eventbrite. Each workshop is $75.\n\nWe are often introduced to new platforms that we adopt without thinking much about how we operate in the digital sphere and whether or not we wish to change our behavior in one way or another. It may be difficult to understand the big picture of our digital presence\, hard to keep track of just how invested we are in digital platforms.  Even if we understand our digital presence\, we may wish to engage certain audiences in one way or another but not know where to start\, or how to plan effectively for that engagement.  In this workshop\, we will explore David O. White's Visitor and Resident Model for digital presence\, and will explore Jasper Visser and Jim Richardson's Digital Engagement Framework\, both as a means for being thoughtful about one's own digital presence\, and for building a strategy around one's digital engagement.

SUMMARY:New monetization strategies for digital collections
DESCRIPTION:Our mission at Livdeo is to provide cultural institutions with technical solutions that support inclusive layers of mediation for all audiences.  How are we connecting with audiences when the physical doors are closed or with audiences from the other side of the world that will never reach the museums' doors?  Collections are the museums' tangible value assets. But they lack multiple descriptions\, narrative lenses\, or multilingual information. Museums need to give collections « superpowers » to let all audiences engage with artworks from any perspective\, anywhere\, and not only those on display.  The exhibitions beyond museums physical walls represent new opportunities. Any wall may become a revenue-generating art asset through augmented reality.  FeelTheArt let all audiences\, regardless of the place and language\, experience art trough augmented reality in complete new ways and create new sustainable revenue streams for cultural institution. \n\nSponsored by LIVDEO.

SUMMARY:Virtual exhibition strategy: Leveraging digital to highlight new voices and expanded content
DESCRIPTION:How can we include new voices in interpretation? This session will address this question with thoughts on the strategy behind the Spencer Museum’s new approach to online exhibition content. Using a flexible web template to create virtual exhibitions that are not exact replicas of in-gallery offerings has allowed for sharing content beyond what is created by curators and educators. This new strategy also facilitates virtual-only exhibitions developed collaboratively with external partners.

SUMMARY:Why and How We Digital
DESCRIPTION:This session offers a framework for developing digital strategies through a lens of experiential design. While we often think of a series of objectives\, outcomes\, and content as the primary drivers of development\, that's an internally driven point of view. Let's view it from the other direction and more fundamentally think about when\, how\, and why we create digital experiences and what it takes to get to those destinations.

SUMMARY:Streaming the Museum: Can Museums Compete with Big Streaming?
DESCRIPTION:Recent video-streaming projects from the Hammer Museum\, the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art\, and Art21 borrow design and process from streaming services like Netflix. While the cultural sector has always competed with Big Entertainment for the attention of audiences\, the competition was more direct during the pandemic\, leaving the screen as a main stage for culture and entertainment. What have cultural organizations learned from commercial streaming platforms? Is it possible to play in the same pool and compete with those platforms?

SUMMARY:Funders’ Office Hours: Getty Foundation
DESCRIPTION:Make an appointment with a program officer to discuss possibilities for funding your digital project. Representatives from several foundations are available to consult during the conference.\n\nGetty Foundation\n\nSchedule a conversation with Associate Director Anne Helmreich via Calendly.\n\nBrief description of the foundation and the digital projects they fund:\n\nThe Getty Foundation fulfills the philanthropic mission of the Getty Trust by supporting individuals and institutions committed to advancing the greater understanding and preservation of the visual arts in Los Angeles and throughout the world. Since 2013\, the Getty Foundation’s Digital Art History initiative has supported both introductory and advanced training in the technical and conceptual aspects of digital practice for art historians\, academics\, and museum professionals. In addition\, we have provided direct support for a small number of DAH projects since 2018\, with a focus on spatial analysis (historical GIS\, digital mapping\, and 3D modeling of built cultural heritage) and image analysis (machine vision\, pattern recognition\, and visual search). Prior to launching the DAH initiative\, the Foundation organized the Online Scholarly Cataloguing Initiative (OSCI)\, which from 2009 to 2015 supported nine museums piloting the transition of the scholarly museum collection catalogue to online platforms. The Foundation is not currently accepting new proposals in the Digital Art History initiative\, as we are in the early stages of a strategic analysis of the initiative’s goals. We invite conversations with colleagues that can help us assess the state of the field\, particularly in light of the digital turn experienced across the museum sector as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic\, so that we can understand better the current needs and future directions. We plan to relaunch the DAH initiative in spring 2022.

SUMMARY:Help us Help you: How can L2 build tools that better serve the museum space?
DESCRIPTION:In the spring of 2020 L2 launched Donate2 as a way to help our clients have an easier way to fundraise during the pandemic. From there we added Flex2 forms\, allowing for membership and events\, and Stream2 forms\, which opened the door for monetizing streaming content through our partnership with Brightcove. What started out as quick donations to help development teams evolved into cart-free transactions that are utilized organization wide. Our ability to rapidly turn feedback into features allows our clients the ability to offer their patrons seamless solutions.\n\nEvery step of the way has been guided by conversations with members of the community. We have spent the better part of the past 20 years partnering with Arts and Cultural and we've seen that our clients work more efficiently if they have the right data in the right place at the right time - not all the data in all the places. We achieve this by helping to connect the dots across siloed systems. We integrate with tools you love and use instead of reinventing the wheel so you can build the stack that meets your unique needs.\n\nDuring this session we will start off with an intro into L2\, what we currently offer\, and a few examples of how museums are using our tools today and then we want to hear from you. We'll ask questions like...\n\n-How could technology help you grow your member and donor base?\n-What are the pain points with your current donation/membership/digital streaming platform?\n-How can we partner to help you and other museums continue to grow?\n\nL2 Interactive is sponsoring this session.

SUMMARY:All Hands On Deck: Recognizing Rapid Digital Growth During COVID-19 and Planning for Future Sustainability
DESCRIPTION:COVID-19 made digital projects–for our museum\, mainly Collections Online–a priority\, because it was the only way we could share our collection\, and our staff could collaboratively work on them during stay-at-home orders. As we look post-pandemic\, we recognize that few of our staff have digital work as a named job responsibility. We must examine how to continue advancing digital projects and urge broader recognition of the role of every staff member in digital project success post-pandemic.

SUMMARY:How to make a digital audio guide profitable for your venue
DESCRIPTION:Digital audio guides (such as native apps or PWAs) are very difficult to monetize. They mostly end up being an expense borne by the museum in the name of visitor service\, and small museums can often not afford it. With its Audio Guide Visitors Keep\, Nubart offers an elegant way of monetization that is very well accepted by visitors. The secret lies in offering a non-transferable but reusable access card that also allows the printing of a sponsor's logo.\n\nNubart is sponsoring this session.

SUMMARY:How to encourage your visitors to interact with your venue using an audio guide.
DESCRIPTION:Most audio guides are a passive element for the visitor. However\, they can also be a perfect tool for visitors to interact with the museum. Nubart's audio guide cards allow visitors to easily exchange documents with museum staff\, or leave voice messages explaining their story or testimony. Ideal for historical museums\, but also to propose photo contests or other similar initiatives. Come and we will help you find ways to implement it!\n\nNubart is sponsoring this session.

SUMMARY:How to Unionize Your Museum
DESCRIPTION:This session will be a practical how-to discussion of the process of unionization\, where attendees can learn from the real-life experience of people who have organized in the museum workplace. We’ll cover the enormous benefits of collective bargaining\, including rights\, benefits\, and protections won by existing museum unions. But we’ll also have frank discussion of the major and myriad obstacles to unionizing. Museum workers need a space to talk about labor issues without fear of retaliation.

DESCRIPTION:The presentation is about our API journey through the museum’s digital infrastructure transition. Since Cooper Hewitt debuted the API in 2012\, it has been a valuable tool for its audiences. Yet in 2021\, as we emerge out of the pandemic and multiple crises\, the team found a redeveloped API is much needed in response to the new challenges. In collaboration with Knowledge Integration and Surface Impression\, we want to share what we learned from this journey\, both internally and with our audiences.

DESCRIPTION:For museum people\, “storytelling” has been a buzzword for years. But beyond “everything is a story\,” what can we learn from literature about how we tell stories in spaces?\n\nIn this session\, we’ll share an approach to developing digital (and analog) experiences using techniques from literature to invite visitors to inhabit a story. Participants will put these tools into practice in a creative play and visioning session where we’ll all take on the role of creative storytellers.

DESCRIPTION:Make an appointment with a program officer to discuss possibilities for funding your digital project. Representatives from several foundations are available to consult during the conference.\n\nGetty Foundation\n\nSchedule a conversation with Associate Director Anne Helmreich via Calendly.\n\nSchedule a conversation with Senior Program Officer Heather MacDonald via Calendly.\n\nBrief description of the foundation and the digital projects they fund:\n\nThe Getty Foundation fulfills the philanthropic mission of the Getty Trust by supporting individuals and institutions committed to advancing the greater understanding and preservation of the visual arts in Los Angeles and throughout the world. Since 2013\, the Getty Foundation’s Digital Art History initiative has supported both introductory and advanced training in the technical and conceptual aspects of digital practice for art historians\, academics\, and museum professionals. In addition\, we have provided direct support for a small number of DAH projects since 2018\, with a focus on spatial analysis (historical GIS\, digital mapping\, and 3D modeling of built cultural heritage) and image analysis (machine vision\, pattern recognition\, and visual search). Prior to launching the DAH initiative\, the Foundation organized the Online Scholarly Cataloguing Initiative (OSCI)\, which from 2009 to 2015 supported nine museums piloting the transition of the scholarly museum collection catalogue to online platforms. The Foundation is not currently accepting new proposals in the Digital Art History initiative\, as we are in the early stages of a strategic analysis of the initiative’s goals. We invite conversations with colleagues that can help us assess the state of the field\, particularly in light of the digital turn experienced across the museum sector as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic\, so that we can understand better the current needs and future directions. We plan to relaunch the DAH initiative in spring 2022.

SUMMARY:Stronger Together: Facing Retaliatory Tactics In Cultural Institutions
DESCRIPTION:As we witnessed during the last couple of years\, when staff organize seeking better practices and working conditions at institutions that have been unethical\, colonial and/or toxic\, we are often met with diverse patterns of control\, abuse and retaliation. Boards and other decision makers can have unimaginable resources that most of us simply do not have access to: crisis management firms\, expensive lawyers\, PR firms\, powerful friends\, media influence\, etc. The consequence of generations and generations of lack of accountability and transparency has left a sour taste in museum workers across the field; some leaving the field entirely\, some too exhausted to even think of options\, others stuck wanting to leave but unable to\, others hoping that they can say the right thing for things to change for the better. \n\nThis environment has particularly affected BIPOC and colleagues with disabilities\, who are subjected to constant acts of discrimination.\n\nStaff in many museums have lived in fear of being honest about the working conditions that we are subjected to\, taking a stand can sound terrifying\, even inconceivable.\n\nThis session will be an honest conversation about identifying patterns of narcissistic abuse in the museum sector\, understanding how trauma makes us complicit in abusive systems and how we can protect each other from retaliatory practices. We will share examples of different types of tactics that decision makers have used to silence staff\, control the narrative of the situation or even engage in union busting tactics. We will make time to build hope: this situation is not hopeless. It doesn't have to be. But that is up to us. \n\nThis session is NOT under Chatham House Rules. I invite participants to attend as an act of courage and solidarity with those who have put themselves in danger to make the field better and more equitable for all of us.

SUMMARY:Museums in 3021: Irrelevance? Or a Culture Built on Stewardship
DESCRIPTION:It is 3021\, museums disappeared a long time ago after waves of death and rebirth. The empty buildings are toured to show the reminiscent of dusty marble walls and empty offices: it is a reminder of what shall never be repeated again\, a reminder of the death of museums.\n\nYou can imagine it\, can’t you? \n\nIn Barry Lord’s book Art & Energy he puts forth that culture can be tied to the dominant form of energy in a society. He sees a struggle between the culture of consumption\, from the era of oil and natural gas\, and the culture of stewardship\, rising out of things like renewable energy. The culture of consumption prizes consumable experiences (including museum visits) in which ideologies are fashion and humans are a commodity. The culture of stewardship\, however\, fosters values of local engagement\, preservation\, sustainability\, and transparency.\n\nThis session will take these ideas to their logical extreme - in the case of the culture of consumption we will look at a future where there is nothing left for the public in museums or for museum professionals after continued trauma that museums perpetuate on staff and marginalized populations; where technology and the digital are used for control\, surveillance\, and oppression\, where museums are consigned to irrelevance and the dustbin of history. Humanity moved on. Boards and directors are gone. \n\nFor the culture of stewardship\, the session will use the lens of solarpunk science fiction: we will look at museums in 3021 and what a culture of stewardship in museums could look like. Cultural heritage institutions are often viewed as being rooted in the past\, rather than at the cultural vanguard. With the coming of a culture of stewardship we as museum professionals have a rare opportunity to intervene not just in our cultural organizations\, but to the public in general to foster values of equity\, preservation and sustainability.\n\nThe session will end with looking at the direct future - realizing that between these two extremes there is a path forward - but pursuing it would require surmounting complex and even painful challenges. However\, tackling those challenges would reform the digital and the field at large.

SUMMARY:Intercept: the Open Source Solution to Event Management
DESCRIPTION:In 2018\, Richland Library (SC) embarked on an ambitious goal: to engage with customers by tracking their attendance at programs and events and making recommendations based on their activity on their website. Three years\, and much trial and error later\, this open source customer engagement and event management system\, developed by Aten Design Group and Richland Library\, with a grant from the Knight Foundation\, is being used by RAILS\, a consortium of Illinois libraries and Camden County Library System (NJ)\, a mid-sized suburban county system\, in addition to Richland’s urban\, suburban and rural libraries.\n\nAll three systems use Intercept’s base code in different ways\, all three are contributing to building up this new community\, and all three depend on Intercept to engage their users\, helping customers find more of what they love.\n\nJoin Sally Shaughnessy\, Aten’s VP of Client Services and Project Manager for Richland’s Intercept build\, along with Richland\, RAILS and Camden County for a discussion on why Intercept is still the most flexible events management option for not just libraries\, but any nonprofit with events and programming.\n\nAten Design Group is producing this webinar.\n\nREGISTER HERE!

SUMMARY:We can do more together: sharing a collection management system
DESCRIPTION:Since the mid-1990s\, six museums in Western Massachusetts have shared one CMS. The arrangement enables significant collaboration on research and exhibitions\, reduces certain costs and regional collection redundancies\, and allows the public to search all six repositories’ collections at once. Using the example of a current project to correct metadata about and enhance access to Indigenous American collections\, this session will detail how the shared CMS promotes collaborative data creation\, management\, and cost-sharing.

SUMMARY:“It’s not a companion.” One story. Two exhibitions.
DESCRIPTION:Online exhibitions are often “companion websites” to a museum exhibition. During the development of the US Holocaust Memorial Museum’s new special exhibition\, Burma’s Path to Genocide\, we created two experiences to meet the needs of audiences while adhering to the same guiding principles and content goals. This session will explore digital storytelling for web and physical spaces and share techniques for making decisions that are audience-centered and subject-centered.

SUMMARY:Digital Collections as Product
DESCRIPTION:This session will approach the question: "What is the future of online collections?" As many examples move from standalone project to long-running product\, what do they look like and who are they for? How do they fit within a museum's digital content architecture—and within the context of the internet as a whole? As they shift beyond an object-centered model focused on data publishing to a user-centered one\, how does that impact how they are designed\, developed\, maintained\, and funded?

DESCRIPTION:What does a digital record of the professional loss we experienced in 2020 look like? We propose a project using creative storytelling to document stories of professional loss experienced. Cultural workers experienced displacement—whether through layoffs\, untenable working conditions\, or family caregiving. We propose a project that we will debut during MCN 2021— a documentary audio play based on interviews conducted with museum workers who experienced pandemic-related career transitions.

SUMMARY:Karaoke
DESCRIPTION:MCN KARAOKE IS HERE. We may not be able to completely take over a local karaoke place\, but we can still gather\, dance\, laugh\, and sing our hearts out together. MCN Karaoke is a judgement-free space and is welcoming to all. You don't even have to sing to attend! We're so glad you almost made it\, and while everybody wants to rule the world\, we won't stop believing that we're all tiny dancers who are just living on a prayer. \n\nHere's some info to help make your karaoke experience the absolute BEST:\n\n* Use headphones for your audio. Without headphones\, your audio might cut in and out when you're singing\, and we want to be able to hear you!\n\n* We're asking people to prepare their own songs on YouTube and share their screens while they sing. To find a karaoke song on YouTube\, go to youtube.com\, type the name of your song + karaoke\, e.g.\, "bohemian rhapsody karaoke". Take a listen to the first few results\, and you should find one that works.\n\n* Join the #karaoke Slack channel for karaoke updates!
